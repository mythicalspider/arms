property
  contains a single measurable value
  has a name which may the same as other properties
    in which case the only way to distinguish it is by property group

property class
  the class of a property determines 
    how it will be observed
    what properties it depends on
    how it can be fixed
    how it is installed

property group
  contains 0 or more properties
  may be nested
  can't have two properties with the same name
  purpose
    easy access of specific properties
    control of resource provisioning
      when a property is being automatically provisioned, it will search parent property groups until it finds the needed resource

property status
  how well the observed value of a property matches it's expected value
  color:
    violet - no issues: service unused / idle. 
    blue - no issues: performing far above the required levels, lots of resources to spare (under 1/4 capacity)
    green - no issues: within normal operating levels
    yellow - minor issues: below required levels / over capacity, but still functional. Will need to address this issue eventually.
    orange - major issues: significantly below required performance levels, failures happening, but still mostly functional. 
    red - critical issues: services are down
    grey - major issues: monitoring is failing or unavailable. Status unknown.
  severity:
    0 - no issues (violet, blue, green)
    1 - minor (yellow)
    2 - major (orange, grey)
    3 - critical (red)
